# Help & Support System: Deployment Follow-Up Tasks

## Overview

This document outlines the follow-up tasks needed to address the deployment issues encountered with the Help & Support system implementation. These tasks align with BuildTrack Pro's Phase 1 development workflow which prioritizes merging core functionality with proper documentation of known issues.

## Known Issues

1. **Path Resolution During Build**:
   - Module imports using aliases like `@/app/components` fail during Vercel production builds
   - Preview deployment works but production deployment fails with module resolution errors
   - Current workaround uses mock components and non-blocking build steps in CI

2. **Environment Variable Handling**:
   - Inconsistent environment variable behavior between local, CI, and production environments
   - Supabase initialization fails in certain build contexts
   - Current solution uses conditional initialization based on environment detection

## Recommended Solutions

### Short-term (Immediate)

1. **Finalize Module Resolution Configuration**:
   - Update `next.config.js` to properly handle path aliases in all environments
   - Ensure consistency between local and production environments
   - Test configuration changes in a controlled branch

2. **Standardize Environment Variable Approach**:
   - Create a unified environment variable handling strategy
   - Update `.env.example` with all required variables
   - Add validation checks for critical variables

3. **Remove Temporary Workarounds**:
   - Replace mock components with proper implementations
   - Update the CI workflow to use the standard build process
   - Remove conditional code paths for build-only environments

### Medium-term (Next Sprint)

1. **Refactor Import Structure**:
   - Reorganize imports to follow a consistent pattern
   - Document import conventions in the project README
   - Create ESLint rules to enforce import standards

2. **Improve Build Process**:
   - Set up more detailed build logging for troubleshooting
   - Add pre-build validation steps for environment configuration
   - Create deployment-specific tests to catch issues early

3. **Enhance Deployment Documentation**:
   - Update deployment guides with environment requirements
   - Add troubleshooting section for common deployment issues
   - Create a deployment checklist for new features

## Action Items

| Task | Priority | Estimated Effort | Assigned To | Due Date |
|------|----------|------------------|-------------|----------|
| Update path alias configuration | High | 2 hours | TBD | Next sprint |
| Standardize environment variables | High | 3 hours | TBD | Next sprint |
| Remove temporary mocks | Medium | 4 hours | TBD | Next sprint |
| Add deployment tests | Medium | 6 hours | TBD | Next sprint |
| Update documentation | Low | 2 hours | TBD | Next sprint |

## Conclusion

These follow-up tasks will ensure the Help & Support system works reliably in all environments, completing the Phase 1 implementation according to BuildTrack Pro's development standards. The immediate goal is to maintain the functionality delivered by the current PR while addressing the underlying deployment infrastructure issues in upcoming work.
