## Test Cases

### 1. Language Detection and Routing

| Test ID | Description | Expected Result |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| LD-01 | First visit with no saved preferences | Should detect browser language and redirect to appropriate locale version |
| LD-02 | Visit with saved language preference cookie | Should honor saved preference regardless of browser language |
| LD-03 | Manual URL navigation to non-default language | Should maintain selected language and set preference cookie |
| LD-04 | Authenticated user with profile language setting | Should prioritize profile setting over browser language |
| LD-05 | Direct navigation to route without locale prefix | Should redirect to route with appropriate locale prefix |

### 2. Language Selector Component

| Test ID | Description | Expected Result |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| LS-01 | Language dropdown visibility and styling | Should match BuildTrack Pro design system with proper colors and shadows |
| LS-02 | Language selector - keyboard accessibility | Should be fully navigable with keyboard (Tab, Enter, Escape) |
| LS-03 | Language selector - screen reader compatibility | Should announce options properly with ARIA attributes |
| LS-04 | Flag icons and language names display | Should show correct flag emoji and localized language name |
| LS-05 | Current language indication | Should clearly indicate which language is currently active |
| LS-06 | Language switching animation | Should have smooth fade transition when changing languages |
| LS-07 | Dropdown positioning on small screens | Should properly position dropdown menu on mobile devices |

### 3. Translation Content

| Test ID | Description | Expected Result |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| TC-01 | Complete coverage of UI elements | All visible text should be translated with no "MISSING_MESSAGE" errors |
| TC-02 | Construction terminology accuracy | Industry-specific terms should be correctly translated for each locale |
| TC-03 | Variable interpolation | Variables within translations (e.g., {name}) should render correctly |
| TC-04 | Numerical formatting | Numbers should follow locale-specific formatting (e.g., 1,000.00 vs 1.000,00) |
| TC-05 | Date formatting | Dates should display in locale-appropriate format |
| TC-06 | Right-to-left (RTL) text support | Placeholder for future RTL language support |
| TC-07 | Fallback handling | Missing translations should gracefully fall back to English |

### 4. UI Layout Adaptation

| Test ID | Description | Expected Result |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| UI-01 | Text expansion in translated content | UI should accommodate longer text in languages like German or Portuguese |
| UI-02 | Mobile layout with translated content | Mobile layouts should adjust for text length differences across languages |
| UI-03 | Form input localization | Form inputs should accept special characters from all supported languages |
| UI-04 | Truncation and ellipsis handling | Truncated text should respect word boundaries in each language |
| UI-05 | Button sizing with translations | Buttons should adapt width for different text lengths while maintaining design |

### 5. Performance Testing

| Test ID | Description | Expected Result |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| PT-01 | Initial load time per language | Page load performance should be similar across all languages |
| PT-02 | Translation file size and loading | Translation files should be efficiently loaded and cached |
| PT-03 | Language switching performance | Language changes should occur without noticeable delay |
| PT-04 | Mobile performance impact | Translation system should not significantly impact mobile performance |
| PT-05 | Memory usage with translations | Application should not have increased memory issues due to translation handling |

## Testing Methodology

### Manual Testing Checklist

For each supported language (en, es, fr, pt-BR):

1. **Navigate through core user journeys:**
   - Homepage and marketing content
   - Authentication flows (login/register)
   - Dashboard navigation
   - Project management features
   - Settings and preferences

2. **Verify all UI elements:**
   - Navigation items
   - Buttons and CTAs
   - Form labels and placeholders
   - Error messages
   - Loading indicators
   - Tooltips and help text

3. **Interaction patterns:**
   - Modal dialogs
   - Dropdown menus
   - Form submissions
   - Error handling
   - Success confirmations

### Automated Testing

1. **Unit tests:**
   - Translation hooks and utilities
   - Language detection logic
   - Cookie storage mechanisms

2. **Integration tests:**
   - Language switching workflows
   - Routing with locale prefixes
   - Auth flows with different languages

3. **Visual regression tests:**
   - UI component rendering across languages
   - Layout stability with different text lengths

## Reporting and Documentation

Test results should be documented with:

1. Screenshots of key UI elements in each language
2. Browser/device combinations tested
3. Any identified issues or discrepancies
4. Performance metrics across languages

## Accessibility Compliance

All internationalization features must comply with WCAG 2.1 AA standards, including:

- Proper language attributes on HTML elements
- Sufficient color contrast in all languages
- Keyboard navigability of language selector
- Screen reader compatibility with translated content

## Continuous Testing Strategy

1. Implement automated tests as part of CI/CD pipeline
2. Test all supported languages with each release
3. Periodically review for missing translations
4. Validate performance metrics across languages
