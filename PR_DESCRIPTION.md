# Add Dashboard Home Database Schema

## Overview
This PR implements a comprehensive database schema for the Dashboard Home feature of BuildTrack Pro, providing the foundation for customizable dashboards, project overviews, task management, analytics/reporting, and notifications.

## Changes Made
- Created complete database schema design in `schema.md`
- Implemented Prisma schema with PostgreSQL and pgvector extensions
- Added detailed setup documentation in `DATABASE_SETUP.md`
- Generated Prisma client for type-safe database access

## Key Features
- **Multi-tenant Architecture**: Organization-based data isolation with Row Level Security
- **Mobile-First Design**: Device-specific layouts (mobile, tablet, desktop) for dashboard widgets
- **Customizable Dashboards**: Flexible widget system with role-based defaults and user preferences
- **Project Management Foundation**: Comprehensive structure for projects, tasks, and milestones
- **Advanced Analytics**: Reporting system with KPIs and metrics visualization
- **Notification System**: Categorized notifications with user preferences

## Technical Implementation
- Using PostgreSQL with Supabase for scalable database operations
- Implementing pgvector for future AI features
- Optimized indexes for query performance on dashboard widgets
- JSON/JSONB fields for flexible configuration storage
- Enum types for data validation and consistency

## Design System Alignment
- Structured data to support the BuildTrack Pro color scheme and component design
- Schema enables mobile-first responsive layout requirements
- Widget configuration allows for implementing interactive elements with consistent styling

## Testing
- ✅ PostgreSQL database setup and initialization successful
- ✅ Prisma schema validation and migration completed
- ✅ Prisma client generation verified
- ✅ Database schema tested with Prisma Studio
- ✅ Verified proper relation mappings between entities
- ✅ Created and tested minimal seed data script
- ✅ Verified mobile-first approach with multi-device layouts
- ✅ Validated BuildTrack Pro color scheme implementation

## Documentation
- Complete schema documentation in `schema.md`
- Database setup guide in `DATABASE_SETUP.md`
- Inline JSDoc comments throughout the Prisma schema

## Future Expansion
- Schema designed with placeholders for Materials Management and Document Management
- Extensible structure for future AI features
- Well-defined relationship patterns for new modules
