## Database Schema Design for Dashboard Home Feature

### Background and Motivation
- **Goal**: Design a database schema to support the Dashboard Home feature for BuildTrack Pro, building on the completed Authentication feature.
- **Feature Requirements**: The Dashboard Home needs to support customizable widgets, project overviews, task management, analytics/reporting, and notifications as detailed in `features/402-buildtrack-pro-dashboard-home.mdc`.
- **Tech Stack**: Using PostgreSQL via Supabase, Prisma ORM, and implementing Row Level Security (RLS) as specified in `features/tech-stack.mdc`.
- **Design Principles**: Following mobile-first approach, user-centric design, scalability, and accessibility standards.

### Key Challenges and Analysis
- **Multi-tenant Data Isolation**: Ensuring proper data isolation between organizations using Supabase's Row Level Security.
- **Customizable Dashboard Structure**: Supporting widget customization, role-based defaults, and layout persistence across devices.
- **Performance Optimization**: Designing efficient data structures for dashboard widgets to minimize load times on mobile devices.
- **Future Extensibility**: Creating a schema that can easily expand to support Project Management and Materials Management features in the future.
- **Real-time Updates**: Structuring data to support Supabase Realtime for live dashboard updates.

### High-level Schema Design Overview

#### Core Entities from Authentication (Existing)
- We assume the Authentication feature includes `organizations`, `users`, and `roles` tables with appropriate relationships.

#### New Entities for Dashboard Home

1. **Dashboard Configuration Schema**
   - Supports widget definitions, layouts, and user preferences
   - Enables role-based default dashboards with customization
   - Maintains separate device-specific layouts (mobile-first)

2. **Project Overview Schema**
   - Basic project structure to support project cards and timelines
   - Project status tracking and health metrics
   - Milestone tracking for timeline visualization

3. **Task Management Schema**
   - Task structure with assignments, statuses, and priorities
   - Support for task dependencies and critical path identification
   - Team workload visualization data

4. **Analytics & Reporting Schema**
   - Aggregated metrics for dashboard visualizations
   - Project progress and financial data structures
   - Performance metrics for team members

5. **Notification System Schema**
   - Notification types and user preferences
   - Delivery status tracking
   - Priority and categorization support

### Executor's Feedback and Assistance Requests

I've completed the design of the database schema for the Dashboard Home feature and documented it in `schema.md`. The schema includes:

1. **Core Identity & Access Control**:
   - Organizations, users, roles, and permissions with appropriate relationships
   - Team structure with team members having specific roles
   - Row Level Security (RLS) policies for multi-tenant data isolation

2. **Dashboard Configuration**:
   - Widget system with support for different sizes and customizable settings
   - Device-specific layouts (mobile, tablet, desktop) as requested
   - Dashboard layouts with grid positioning for widgets
   - Role-based defaults that can be customized per user

3. **Project Management Foundation**:
   - Project structure with status tracking and progress percentage
   - Task management with priorities, statuses, and dependencies
   - Critical path identification for schedule-critical tasks
   - Milestone tracking for timeline visualization

4. **Notification System**:
   - Comprehensive notification types with priorities and categories
   - User-specific notification preferences
   - Read status tracking for improved user experience

All tables include proper indexes for query performance and appropriate JSON fields for flexibility. The schema is designed to be extended for future features while focusing on immediate implementation needs.

**Next steps**:
1. Create feature branch `feat/dashboard-schema` from `development` branch
2. Commit schema-related changes (schema.md, prisma/schema.prisma)
3. Execute migrations in environments with PostgreSQL
4. Test the schema with sample data
5. Create PR according to workflow rules

**Implementation progress**:
1. Created a comprehensive Prisma schema implementing all the tables and relationships described in `schema.md`
2. Switched the database provider from SQLite to PostgreSQL as specified in the tech stack
3. Added pgvector extension support for future AI features
4. Implemented proper indexes on all tables for query performance
5. Created enums for statuses and priorities to enforce data consistency
6. Designed and implemented Analytics & Reporting data structures including:
   - Reports and report scheduling capabilities
   - Metric definitions with various aggregation types
   - KPI targets with thresholds and tracking
   - Dashboard metrics with visualization types
   - Analytics snapshots for historical data

**Technical notes**:
- The schema uses PostgreSQL-specific features like JSONB (via Prisma's Json type) for flexible widget settings
- Added proper cascade delete rules where appropriate to maintain data integrity
- The dashboard configuration supports device-specific layouts with role-based defaults
- The task management system includes critical path identification and task dependencies
- Temporarily commented out some relations to avoid circular dependencies during initial migration

**Git Workflow Status**:
- ✅ Successfully stashed changes from `fix/auth-callback-conflict` branch
- ✅ Created and switched to new branch `feat/dashboard-schema-from-auth` from `fix/auth-callback-conflict`
- ✅ Successfully added schema files: schema.md, prisma/schema.prisma, DATABASE_SETUP.md
- ✅ Successfully committed changes with message "Add comprehensive database schema for Dashboard Home feature"
- ✅ Successfully generated Prisma client with the new schema
- ✅ Created proper feature branch `feat/dashboard-schema-proper` from `development` (following workflow rules)
- ✅ Cherry-picked schema changes to new branch
- ✅ Created comprehensive PR description
- ✅ Created seed data files for testing schema
- ✅ Added package.json with required dependencies
- ✅ Successfully committed seed data and package.json with message "Add seed data and package.json for database schema validation"

**Migration Status**:
- PostgreSQL connection not available at localhost:5432
- Created DATABASE_SETUP.md with detailed setup instructions
- Prisma schema updated and validated
- Successfully generated Prisma client
- Migration execution pending PostgreSQL availability

**Next Actions**:
- Create Pull Request from `feat/dashboard-schema-proper` to `development`
- Execute migrations when PostgreSQL is available
- Implement initial API endpoints for dashboard configuration
- Add Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) policies when database is available

**Questions**:
- Are there any specific metrics that should be pre-configured for the initial deployment?
- Do we need any additional tables or fields for specialized reports (financial, resource allocation, etc.)?
- Should we create database migration scripts for the initial schema?
- Do we want to set up automated testing for our database entities and relationships?
